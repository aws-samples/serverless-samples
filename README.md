[lambda-ecs-dual-deploy](./lambda-ecs-dual-deploy) - AWS Lambda / ECS Dual Deploy Sample Application that demonstrates the steps necessary to build a container image that runs on both AWS Lambda and on another container service like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

[serverless-rest-api](./serverless-rest-api) - These REST API examples demonstrate end-to-end implementations of a simple application using a serverless approach that includes CI/CD pipelines, automated unit and integration testing, and workload observability. The examples include multiple implementations of the same application using a variety of development platform and infrastructure as a code approaches.
