# Centralized Developer Guidance - Kiro Power Sample

This is a sample Kiro Power implementation that demonstrates how organizations can provide centralized, AI-powered developer guidance across all teams. The sample connects to an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore-based agent with access to a Knowledge Base containing best practices, governance requirements, and curated documentation. While this example focuses on API development guidance, the architecture can be adapted for any domain — security practices, infrastructure patterns, data engineering, or any area where your organization wants to deliver consistent guidance from a central location.
